                     Locally developed tools and solutions are envisaged to be deployed in manufacturing, chemicals, energy, and mining industries across the country.

                  <p class="resource_class">Mult phenomena multiscale modelling and simulation technologies encompass a variety of approaches aimed at capturing complex systems' behaviour across multiple scales.
                     This includes discrete-event systems models, which focus on events occurring at distinct points in time, Agent-based Simulation Models, which simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents, and continuous modelling and simulation, which deal with systems evolving over continuous time and space. 
                     Integration of these diverse modelling and simulation techniques is crucial for comprehensively understanding and predicting system behaviour. Various integration models exist, such as hybrid approaches combining discrete-event and continuous models, or frameworks that incorporate agent-based models within larger-scale simulations. 
                     These integration models enable us to tackle multifaceted problems and gain insights into systems characterized by diverse phenomena and scales.

                           and data analytics are expected to have a revolutionary impact on modelling, simulation and decision making. 
                           Better use of existing data as well as availability of more standardised, structured, and validated information is fast becoming essential for the ability to reliably simulate options and make sound data-based business decisions. The vast amounts of data readily available in the water, energy, 
                           mining, tourism, and anti-corruption industries make these ideal target markets for application and use of data-driven decision and support tools. The envisaged methods will facilitate the model-based integration of a variety of datasets, critical assessment of the available information, and tailored selection of future data-driven experiments. The so-called hybrid approaches where physics-driven and data-driven modelling and simulation are combined will soon become more important. On the other hand, there is an opportunity for data-driven modelling and simulation to be further enhanced to become a valuable source of data in the âbig dataâ realm.
                           As such, data-driven modelling and simulation technology is becoming an integral part of a digital R&D organisation.</p>
